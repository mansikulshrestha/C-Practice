Minimum Platforms Problem

Problem Statement

Given the arrival and departure times of trains, determine the minimum number of platforms required at a railway station so that no train waits.

Example
If the arrival and departure times are as follows:

Arrivals: [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]
Departures: [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
Then, the minimum number of platforms required to accommodate all trains is 3.

Approach

This problem is solved by determining the maximum number of trains at the station at any time.

Steps
Sort the Arrival and Departure Times:
Sorting both arr and dep arrays allows us to systematically check for overlapping train schedules.
Two-Pointer Technique:
Use two pointers, i and j, initialized to the beginning of the arr and dep arrays, respectively.
Traverse the arrays using these pointers:
If a train arrives (arr[i] <= dep[j]), increment the platform count and move to the next arrival.
If a train departs (arr[i] > dep[j]), decrement the platform count and move to the next departure.
Track the Maximum Platforms Required:
At each step, record the maximum platform count reached, which is the answer to the problem.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: 
O(nlogn)
O(nlogn), where n is the number of trains. This is due to sorting.
Space Complexity: O(1) additional space, since we only use a few extra variables.
